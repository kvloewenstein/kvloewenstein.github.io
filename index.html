       <p>
      Hello! I'm Kennedy Loewenstein, an aspiring web developer with a strong passion for creating intuitive and visually engaging user experiences. 
      My background includes hands-on practice with <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React</strong>, as well as foundational knowledge in back-end technologies like <strong>Java, SQL, and Spring Boot</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, elegant solutions. My goal is to grow as a front-end developer while contributing to meaningful projects that make a positive impact on users. 
      I'm currently exploring modern frameworks, responsive design, and performance optimization to build efficient and accessible applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of coding, I’m constantly learning! Whether it’s experimenting with new tools, reading about emerging tech trends, or collaborating with peers on creative projects. 
      I’m excited to connect with others who share a passion for technology and innovation.
